# Hey, I'm Ibrahim  

**Software Developer**  
Ugandan | Open to global collaboration  
üéß Music is my guy |  ‚öΩ Football keeps me sharp



## About Me  
I‚Äôm a **Full-Stack Developer** who loves building software that solves real problems and delivers great user experiences. My passion for software development was clear, but my journey initially led me into **Network and System Administration**. While that path strengthened my understanding of systems and infrastructure, my heart was always drawn back to **software development**. That passion reignited when I realized that through code, I could **build something meaningful, tools people can use freely, and technology that can change the world in positive ways**.  
Software, to me, isn‚Äôt just a career, it‚Äôs a way to make impact.  

I believe good code should not only work, it should *feel right*.  
I enjoy architecting systems, simplifying complexity, and continuously improving.
